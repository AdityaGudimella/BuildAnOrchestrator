# Build an Orchestrator Engine

## Introduction

I've started reading a book called [Build an Orchestrator in Go](https://www.manning.com/books/build-an-orchestrator-in-go-from-scratch)
by `Tim Boring`. The book helps you understand orchestrator engines like Kubernetes by
building our own Orchestrator engine. The book is written in Go, but I'm going to build
the orchestrator engine in multiple languages in parallel.

## Programming languages in this book

This book currently contains the following programming languages:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/csharp)

I plan to add the following languages to this book in the future:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [C++](https://isocpp.org/) (maybe)
